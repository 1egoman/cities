# Neighborhoods

Just walking around, it's a very diverse place. There's a real mix of socioeconomic levels I've not experienced in any other place but NYC.

## Ventura Village

* Where I stayed on my July 2021 trip
* Demographics: Majority Black, Muslim, East African
* Peavey Field Park is a good place to eat lunch / dinner outside

## Whittier

* Westcott-ish suburb feel \(ie, old houses, small roads, wooded\)
* **Yeah Yeah Taco** - really really good burritos
