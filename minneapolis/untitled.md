### Significant amounts of **quality** bike infrastructure ‚úÖ 

* Bike lanes along every major road, or a shoulder that's wide enough to bike on
* Cars seem to be more used to bikes than other cities where cars rule \(ie, Syracuse\)
* It's used significantly by people from all backgrounds

#### Minneapolis Greenway

* A bike highway through the middle of Minneapolis that's sunken down
* Really solid piece of infrastructure
* Has "on ramps" and "off ramps" which are not all obvious to find...
